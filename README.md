## About üìù
Mohit Kumar portfolio is a personal project that I started to showcase achievements and skills. I made this also to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and javascript. then I got thought to take it forward and open it as an open source. Many beginners find it difficult to find a project that is easy to contribute to as either they are to complex or they have less knowledge of that tech stack. this will give them a small push helping them to be a part of the open source community.
